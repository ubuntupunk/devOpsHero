## Setting Up a Productive Terminal Environment

### Customizing Your Shell

#### Bash Configuration (~/.bashrc)

```bash
# Add these to your ~/.bashrc file

# Useful aliases
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias ..='cd ..'
alias ...='cd ../..'

# Git aliases (we'll use these in later chapters)
alias gs='git status'
alias ga='git add'
alias gc='git commit'
alias gp='git push'
alias gl='git log --oneline'

# Docker aliases (for future chapters)
alias d='docker'
alias dc='docker-compose'
alias k='kubectl'
# Useful functions (or: How to Become a Digital Wizard)

# The Philosophy of Functions: Are We All Just Prompts?
# 
# Here's a mind-bending thought: What if the entire universe is just a massive function?
# You input energy and matter, apply the laws of physics, and get reality as output.
# In prompt theory (yes, that's a real thing in AI), we're all just prompts in some
# cosmic language model, generating responses based on our inputs and context.
#
# In the shell, functions are your way of creating mini-universes—self-contained
# realities that take inputs and produce predictable outputs. They're like having
# a personal assistant who never forgets, never gets tired, and always does exactly
# what you programmed them to do.

# The "Why Functions?" Existential Crisis
#
# Why do we create functions? Because humans are fundamentally lazy in the most
# productive way possible. We hate repeating ourselves. We hate typing the same
# commands over and over. We hate explaining the same process to our future selves.
#
# Functions are our rebellion against repetition, our declaration that we're too
# clever to do the same thing twice. They're also our gift to our future selves—
# little packages of wisdom wrapped in executable code.

function mkcd() {
    # The "mkdir and cd" combo that everyone needs but nobody wants to type twice
    # This function embodies the principle: "If I'm creating a directory, 
    # I probably want to go there immediately."
    mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}

function extract() {
    # The universal file extractor - because life's too short to remember
    # whether it's tar -xzf or unzip or 7z x or whatever arcane incantation
    # the file format gods demand this time.
    #
    # This function is basically saying: "I don't care what format this is,
    # just make the contents appear. Figure it out, computer!"
    
    if [ -f $1 ] ; then
        case $1 in
            *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf $1     ;;
            *.tar.gz)    tar xzf $1     ;;
            *.bz2)       bunzip2 $1     ;;
            *.rar)       unrar e $1     ;;
            *.gz)        gunzip $1      ;;
            *.tar)       tar xf $1      ;;
            *.tbz2)      tar xjf $1     ;;
            *.tgz)       tar xzf $1     ;;
            *.zip)       unzip $1       ;;
            *.Z)         uncompress $1  ;;
            *.7z)        7z x $1        ;;
            *)     echo "'$1' cannot be extracted via extract()" ;;
        esac
    else
        echo "'$1' is not a valid file"
    fi
}

# Bonus functions for the truly enlightened

function weather() {
    # Because sometimes you need to know if it's raining before you decide
    # whether to walk to the coffee shop or work from home all day
    curl -s "wttr.in/$1"
}

function myip() {
    # Your digital identity in the vast ocean of the internet
    curl -s ifconfig.me && echo
}

function ports() {
    # See what's listening on your machine - like having X-ray vision for network traffic
    netstat -tuln
}

function diskspace() {
    # The "how much digital hoarding have I done lately?" function
    du -sh * | sort -hr
}

# The Meta-Function: A Function That Creates Functions
function makefunc() {
    # This is where we get recursive: a function that helps you create functions
    # It's functions all the way down!
    echo "function $1() {" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "    # TODO: Add your function body here" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "}" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo "Function template for '$1' added to ~/.bashrc"
    echo "Edit ~/.bashrc to complete your function, then run 'source ~/.bashrc'"
}

# The Philosophical Implications
#
# When you create a function, you're essentially creating a new word in your
# personal command language. You're extending the vocabulary of your shell,
# making it more expressive, more suited to your specific needs.
#
# In a way, your .bashrc becomes a reflection of your digital personality—
# the shortcuts you value, the tasks you perform frequently, the way you
# think about efficiency and automation.
#
# Are we all just functions in some cosmic shell script? Maybe. But at least
# we can write our own helper functions along the way.
}

# Enhanced prompt with git branch (install git first)
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h:\[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\]$ "

# History settings
export HISTSIZE=10000
export HISTFILESIZE=20000
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups
shopt -s histappend
```

#### Zsh Configuration (if using zsh)

```bash
# Install Oh My Zsh (optional but recommended)
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Edit ~/.zshrc to customize
# Popular plugins: git, docker, kubectl, terraform
plugins=(git docker kubectl terraform aws)
```

### Essential Tools to Install

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install -y curl wget git vim htop tree jq unzip

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install -y curl wget git vim htop tree jq unzip

# macOS
brew install curl wget git vim htop tree jq unzip
```
