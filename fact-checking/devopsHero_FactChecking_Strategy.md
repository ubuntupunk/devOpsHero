## Available Fact-Checking Tools

### **Current Available Tool: Brave Search**

**Brave Search - Our Primary Verification Tool**
- **Strengths:** Privacy-focused, good technical coverage, native search operators
- **Use cases:** All fact-checking needs - documentation, pricing, features, tutorials
- **Search operators available:**
  - `site:github.com` - Search specific sites
  - `filetype:pdf` - Find specific file types
  - `intitle:` - Search in page titles
  - `inurl:` - Search in URLs
  - `"exact phrase"` - Exact phrase matching
  - `before:2024` / `after:2023` - Date filtering

**Maximizing Brave Search Effectiveness:**
- Use multiple search strategies for each fact
- Combine operators for precise results
- Cross-reference multiple authoritative sources
- Focus on official documentation and recent content

### **Manual Verification Approach**

**Since we only have Brave Search available, we'll use a manual but systematic approach:**

**1. Multi-Source Cross-Referencing**
- Search the same fact across 3+ authoritative sources
- Use different search terms and operators for each query
- Compare information for consistency and currency

**2. Official Documentation Priority**
- Always start with official project websites
- Use `site:` operator to search specific authoritative domains
- Look for recent updates and version information

**3. Community Validation**
- Check GitHub repositories for recent activity and issues
- Search Stack Overflow for real-world usage patterns
- Look for recent blog posts from recognized experts

**4. Date and Version Verification**
- Use `after:2023` to find recent information
- Always note the publication date of sources
- Cross-check version numbers and compatibility

**Step 1: Official Documentation**
```
Query: site:git-scm.com "git gc" documentation
Result: Found official Git documentation at https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc
Key finding: "This option will cause git gc to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time"
```

**Step 2: Performance Impact Research**
```
Query: "git gc --aggressive" performance impact after:2023
Result: Multiple Stack Overflow discussions confirming resource intensity
Key finding: "Usually git gc runs very quickly while providing good disk space utilization and performance. This option will cause git gc to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking much more time."
```

**Step 3: Community Validation**
